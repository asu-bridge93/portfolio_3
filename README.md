## Project Overview

This machine learning project implements a facial recognition system specifically designed to classify K-pop idols from the group TOMORROW X TOGETHER (TXT). The project explores image classification capabilities using modern deep learning approaches while focusing on a domain of personal interest.

## Motivation & Background

This project emerged from several motivations:

1. **Personal Interest**: Passion for K-pop music and culture
2. **Technical Curiosity**: Interest in exploring practical applications of image classification
3. **Learning Opportunity**: Desire to gain hands-on experience with fine-tuning transformer models
4. **Practical Application**: Creating a useful tool for identifying different K-pop artists

## Implementation Process

### 1. Data Collection

- **Automated Crawling**: Utilized Bing image crawler to gather a large dataset of K-pop idol images
- **Manual Curation**: Filtered images to remove noise and ensure quality
- **Quantity Achievement**: Collected 50 high-quality images per idol
- **Time Efficiency**: Automated process allowed for quick accumulation of training data

### 2. Dataset Preparation & Preprocessing

- **Data Augmentation**: Rotated images left and right by 90Â° to expand dataset to 200 images per idol
- **Face Detection**: Implemented YOLOv8-Face-Detection from Hugging Face
- **Face Cropping**: Applied targeted cropping based on facial bounding boxes coordinates
- **Color Processing**: Tested grayscale conversion to reduce makeup and styling influences

### 3. Model Architecture & Fine-Tuning

I conducted a comparative analysis between human and machine recognition capabilities:

- **Survey Methodology**: Collected data from 10 participants
- **Confusion Matrix Analysis**: Created matrices for both human and AI predictions
- **Similarity Measurement**: Calculated cosine similarity between recognition patterns

| Recognition System | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Human Participants | 55.6% | 0.554 | 0.556 | 0.555 |
| AI Model | 85.0% | 0.80 | 0.80 | 0.80 |

**Key Finding**: The AI model demonstrated higher recognition accuracy in this specific task domain.
